In this puzzle, we are suppsed to find active nodes ('0') withing the grid. Once found, then we have to find the next active  node to the 
right, and the next active node down the grid. If no active node is found. For each active node, we need to print their coordinates (x y);
and if no active nodes are found, then print negative coordinates (-1 -1)
Example1: If there's one active node to the right, and no active nodes down, then it should print: x0 y0 x1 y1 -1 -1.
Example2: If there's one active node down but no active nodes to the right, then it should print: x0 y0 -1 -1 x2 y2.
Example3: If no active nodes are found on either axis, then it should print: x0 y0 -1 -1 -1 -1.
Example4: If active nodes are found on both axis, then it should print all coordinates: x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2.

I used good old conditions and loops along with a two dimentional array. There are other possible solutions, likely shorter than mine.
At any rate. Feel free to use this one as a guide. I have commented it on key areas of the process.

Cheers.
